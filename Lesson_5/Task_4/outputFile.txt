I can't believe this happened again! **** this!
Oh ****, I forgot to bring my keys.
She's such a ***** for spreading those rumors.
That ******* cut me off in traffic.
Don't be an *******, just help me out.
****, this coffee is too hot!
He's a complete **** for treating her that way.
Why are you acting like a **** today?
That joke really pissed me off.
This movie is total ****.
She called me a **** just because of my outfit.
That guy is such a ***** for what he said.
I can't stand that guy, he's a total ******.
That ****** didn't even apologize after bumping into me.
Some ignorant people still use '******' as an insult.
